* Intro
- Z: "Hi, my name is Denise, I'm a new Clojure developer."
- G: "Hi, my name is Daniel, I'm a (slightly more experienced) Clojure
  developer."
- Z: "Six months ago I attended a Den of Clojure meetup and what I
  saw made sense."
  - Talk about Denise's background, a little where she came from and
    how she got to where she was.
- G: "Once I heard Denise's story, it was impossible not to do
  everything I could to help. Plus one of her brothers is a Ruby dev,
  and I wanted to make sure his big sister could teach him a thing or
  two."
  - Talk a little about the Den of Clojure, what we are doing and
    what we hope to accomplish.

* How we explore Clojure together
- With a local peer to peer network setup between our laptops and one
  projecting on the screen, do a brief review of the tmux pairing
  setup we use.
  - Point to the directions for this setup on the Den of Clojure
    Github site.
  - Talk in general about the repl sessions we shared, how it was nice
    to interactively explore the language. From docs to tests,
    everything was right there.
  - Briefly talk about emacs and the benefit of using a text based
    editor for sharing.
- Switch roles, Denise shows me about immutable collections.
  - TODO: look back through the repl sessions
    - What did we start with?
    - What did we learn?
    - How would we do it now?
    - Point to our online curriculum.
      - Pull requests welcome. :)
- Next item out of the repl sessions
  - Have fun exploring things together
  - Do we switch back roles or continue with Denise teaching?
  - Review some of the easy things, review some of the hard things
  - Z: Talk about how Clojure makes sense/cleaner/more simplified, how OO leaves more room for error
      *I feel like it puts less distance/layers/boobie-traps between me and the complier while maintaining syntactic ease 
- Recap
  - What has worked
  - What has been challenging
  - Benefits/drawback of emacs

* Review the curriculum
- Overview of where we are at
  - Section 1: How to start
  - Section 2: emacs...the final frontier
  - Section 3: Printing, "debugging", general IO and workflow in Clojure
  - Section 3: Immutable collections
- Cover where we would like to go
  - Where are the gaps?
  - What would we like to do?
